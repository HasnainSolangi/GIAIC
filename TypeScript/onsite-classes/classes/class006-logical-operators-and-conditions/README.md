## basic TypeScript Conditions, Logical operators & Control Flow Demos 🚦

The repository 📁 showcases various TypeScript examples illustrating fundamental concepts such as conditional logic using if and else statements, the usage of logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`), and the implementation of switch statements. Each example provides concise demonstrations of decision-making processes based on different conditions, enhancing understanding of basic programming principles in TypeScript. 🧠🔗🔄

1. **Simple if and else conditions examples:**
   This section demonstrates basic conditional logic using if and else statements. It provides examples of determining actions based on the value of a variable (`classDay`) and evaluating conditions to determine transportation options based on distance and available funds.

2. **Logical operators in TypeScript:**
   This section illustrates the usage of logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) in TypeScript. It demonstrates logical AND, OR, and NOT operations using boolean variables (`isWeekend`, `isSunny`, `hasCoffee`, `hasTea`, `isRaining`) to make decisions based on various conditions.

3. **Switch example:**
   This section showcases the switch statement in TypeScript. It provides examples of using switch statements to determine the day of the week based on a numeric value (`weekDayNumber`) and preferences for fruits based on string values (`fruit`).
