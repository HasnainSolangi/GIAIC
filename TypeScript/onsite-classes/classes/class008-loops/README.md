## **Introduction**
This directory provides examples of different types of `loops` in TypeScript along with their definitions and use cases.

1. **Initialization:** where the loop starts.
2. **Condition:** checks if the loop should continue.
3. **Increment/Decrement:** updates the loop control variable.


### For Loop
A `for` loop is a control flow statement in TypeScript used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times. It typically consists of three parts:

#### Examples:
1. Printing numbers from 0 to 99.
2. Printing a statement multiple times.
3. Generating multiplication tables.
4. Iterating over arrays or strings.

### For...of Loop
The `for of` loop in TypeScript provides a concise syntax for iterating over iterable objects without the need for maintaining loop counters. It iterates over the values of an iterable, making code more readable.

#### Examples:
1. Iterating over an array of strings.
2. Iterating over a Set.
3. Iterating over the characters of a string.
4. Iterating over the values of an object using Object.entries().
5. Iterating over the values of a Map.

### While & Do while Loop
1. A `while` loop in TypeScript executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. It's suitable for situations where the number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on the condition.
2. A `do while` loop is similar to a while loop, but it always executes its block of code at least once, even if the condition is initially false. After the first iteration, it repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true.

#### Examples:
1. Generating multiplication tables using a while loop.
2. Printing a multiplication table using a do-while loop.
